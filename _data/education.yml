    During my time at NBKRIST I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thoroughly enjoyed my time as college and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *NBKRIST Tech Club* taking on roles such as *Giving presentations on latest technologies* and *Research and development*.
